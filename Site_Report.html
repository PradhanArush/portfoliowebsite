    <h2 class="uno"> <b> Getting Started with HTML and CSS </b> </h2>

    <p class="dos">I began by learning the basics of HTML and CSS. Understanding 
        the initial structure of HTML and the functions of each tag was simple. 
        Making a simple webpage with headings, paragraphs, links, and images gave 
        me a solid foundation, so it felt nice to do that. With CSS, I was able to 
        give my HTML elements a creative flair. Learning about selectors, attributes, 
        and values and how they interact to create a site was rewarding and pleasurable.</p> <br> <hr> <br>

    <h2 class="uno"> <b> Challenges while Learning </b> </h2>

    <p class="dos">One of the first hurdles was to understand the CSS box model.
        It took some effort to understand how margins, paddings and borders interact
        to determine the placement of the pieces. I've often noticed that I'm fiddling
        with various parameters to see how it looks visually. Another challenged was
        to grasp the knack of responsive design. The first time I learned about media
        queries and flexible grid layouts was to make my web pages appear well on
        different screens and devices. Nevertheless, it took time to make these ideas effective. </p> <br> <hr> <br>

    <h2 class="uno"> <b> Design Insights </b> </h2>
    <p class="dos">Another learning lesson was the creation of a user interface. I have a deeper 
        understanding of the value of user experience (UX) and sound design principles.
        It was necessary to balance functionality and beauty. To create a design that is aesthetically
        beautiful and easy to use, I tried various color schemes, typefaces and layout strategies.</p> <br> <hr> <br>

    <h2 class="uno"> <b> Ups and Downs </b> </h2>

    <p class="dos">This journey was not without ups and downs. After hours of tinker, it was incredibly 
        satisfying when everything finally worked correctly. On the other hand, there were moments 
        when i was frustrated looking like nothing worked. But every obstacle I overcame has increased 
        my confidence and skill set.</p> <br> <hr> <br>

    <h2 class="uno"> <b> Conclusion </b> </h2>

    <p class="dos">The experience of learning web programming has been fulfilling .It helped me understand 
        the value of tenacity, the approach to problem solving, and the satisfaction that comes from 
        starting something from scratch. As I continue to learn and grow, I look forward to build
        more complex and innovative web projects.</p>
